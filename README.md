# Northeast Flank Monitor

Open-source OSINT monitoring of military activity across NATO’s northeastern flank (Kaliningrad, western Belarus, Suwałki corridor, Baltics, northeastern Poland, and relevant western Russia).

**Core question:** Is the regional military baseline changing?

Observe behavior. Track the baseline. Compare historically. Do not predict intent.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Single app: public site + protected `/admin` route group
- Top-level `workers/`, `data/`, `docs/` (Python workers and datasets arrive in later steps)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS, MapLibre, Claude pipeline — see `docs/spec.md` and the project MVP plan

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then set ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run dev
```

`ADMIN_PASSWORD` is required, with no default. `npm run dev` and `npm start` exit with an error if it is unset. `npm run build` does not need it.

Dev server defaults to [http://127.0.0.1:43127](http://127.0.0.1:43127).

Admin: [http://127.0.0.1:43127/admin](http://127.0.0.1:43127/admin) (password from `ADMIN_PASSWORD`).

## Current milestone

**Step 1.1** — app scaffold, design tokens (spec §§47–51), shell navigation with stub routes, `/admin` auth gate stub, folder layout for workers/data/docs.
